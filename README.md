# Project Mongo API
GET:
  /titles - "lists all the tv-shows & movies on Netflix"
  /titles/movie - "lists all the movies"
  /titles/movies/:id - "lists a specific movie"
  /titles/tvshows - "lists all the tv-shows"
  /titles/tvshows/:id - "lists a specific tv-shows"
  /titles/latest - "lists all latest titles in a descending     chronological order"
  /titles/latest?limit=<number> -  "Same as above but with the query so you can limit the result to the latest 10 shows for example"
